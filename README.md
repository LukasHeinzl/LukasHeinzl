### Hi there, I'm Lukas ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer from Austria that currently studies Mediatechnology with focus on interactive media (apps, websites, ar/vr, games, etc.).

I started coding at the age of 12 by learning Java through tutorials and a lot of trail and error.
Java was my main language for about nine years before I recently got more into server-side development with PHP. For a couple of months now I've used Kotlin and cannot believe, that I haven't used it earlier.
Over the years I have used the following languages (ranging from used once to having in depth-knowledge) in no particular order:
- Kotlin
- Java
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- C
- C++
- C#
- Lua
- Python
- PHP
- Assembly
- Shell-scripting (Linux and Windows)
- Processing
- SmallBasic

Not programming languages but I still know them:
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL
- Scratch

### OLD disclaimer
Repositories that are marked as OLD are old projects that I uploaded more recently to GitHub.
They have this disclaimer to signal their age even though they have a rather recent commit date.
I still decided to upload them to show my progression as a programmer.
And boy do I have progressed, you will get a stroke when reading through some of my old stuff.
You have been warned!
